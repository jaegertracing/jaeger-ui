## [#81](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/81) Fix Google Analytics tracking (2017-09-26)

Fix #80.

Created an HOC that checks the state of the router and tracks a page-view whenever the URL or query string changes. This is necessary because react-router v4 [did away with the onUpdate](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router/docs/guides/migrating.md#on-properties) lifecycle event.



## [#83](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/83) Fix traceIDs query params clobbering form search (2017-09-26)

Fix #82.

Changed functionality is: traceIDs are ignored when the search form is triggering the search.



## [#77](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/77) Fix trace mini-map blurry when < 60 spans (2017-09-21)

Fix #76.

## [#74](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/74) Make left column adjustable in trace detail (2017-09-20)

Fix #63 .

Column width of span name is now adjustable, within the bounds of [15%, 85%]. It's not clear in the gif, below, but the reduced opacity highlight color is present when dragging the column in either direction.

## [#72](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/72) Use canvas instead of SVG for trace mini-map (2017-09-17)

Fix #61.

- Render span graph via canvas instead of SVG
- Zoom range changed to [0, 1], e.g. time and trace agnostic (allowed removal of some utils)
- "Timeline" -> 0ms
- Use props instead of context to provide span graph with viewing range
- Move all span graph related classes into same folder
- Misc CSS cleanup



## [#71](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/71) [trave view] Mouseover expands truncated text to full length in left column (2017-09-14)

Fix #65.

See attached screenshot (text is blurry due to scaling down retina dpi).

Mouseover in the span name column expands the service/operation text if it is truncated.

Also, fixed regression in header for left column ("Span Name" -> "Service & Operation").

## [#68](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/68) Virtualized scrolling for trace detail view (2017-09-08)

### Description

Started with [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized), but issues around flashes of un-rendered regions while scrolling and dynamically sized / periodically changing content lead to revival of old project that essentially does the same thing: `src/components/TracePage/TraceTimelineViewer/ListView/*`.

`ListView` is more optimized to our needs (and less versatile). These optimizations include:

- Taking the approach of rendering less often and larger amounts of items per render
- Optimizing for scrolling in both directions instead of only the current scroll direction
- Having a concept of minimum and regular ["overscan"](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/docs/overscanUsage.md), which means if the currently rendered list of items meets a minimum buffer, don't render more, but if it doesn't, then render enough meet the minimum buffer and some extra, as well

### Performance

#### Flashes of un-rendered content

- Smaller traces (~500 spans or less)
  - Not really an issue in prod or PR 68
- Larger traces (~5k spans)
  - PR 68 is on par with prod, possible slightly better
  - Still fairly easy to see flashes of un-rendered content
  - Issue was quite aggravated with react-virtualized (hence, a custom solution is implemented)
- Massive traces (~15k spans or more)
  - Flashes of un-rendered content is a significant problem for the release currently in prod
  - PR 68 performance doesn't vary much between 5k and 15k+ traces


#### Performance on a 5,000 span trace

_Sample size of 1._

- /trace/8d224b61611c807f
- Duration: 5.83s
- Services: 11
- Depth: 11
- Spans: 5,013
- Performance recording enabled (degrades performance)

**Initial loading (in milliseconds)**

Task | Prod - PR 53 (ms) | PR 68 (ms) | Ratio | Reduction
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
**Total** | **6,964** | **1,899** | **0.27** | **73%**
Loading | 45 | 32 ||
**Scripting** | **3,051** | **1,198** | **0.39** | **61%**
**Rendering** | **3,126** | **430** | **0.14** | **86%**
Painting | 116 | 34 ||
Other | 626 | 205 ||

Note: Ticket #61 (Use canvas instead of SVG for trace mini-map) will likely further improve initial loading.

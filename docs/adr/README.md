# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Jaeger UI project. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of Jaeger UI, including the context, decision, and consequences of each choice.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide historical context for future contributors.

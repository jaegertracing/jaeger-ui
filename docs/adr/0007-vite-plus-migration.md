# ADR 0007: Migrate to Vite+ (Full Vite Toolchain)

**Status**: Partially Implemented
**Last Updated**: 2026-04-02

---

## TL;DR

Replace the current fragmented toolchain with **Vite+** (`vp` CLI, [viteplus.dev](https://viteplus.dev)) —
a unified, native-performance toolchain that covers building (Rolldown), linting (Oxlint), formatting
(Oxfmt), and testing (Vitest). Once fully rolled out, this migration will replace Webpack, Babel, ESLint,
Prettier, and Jest with a single dependency that has built-in TypeScript support and is not blocked by
`@typescript-eslint` release lag.

---

## Context & Problem

### Current State (after PRs A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F-plexus)

| Concern          | `packages/jaeger-ui`               | `packages/plexus`                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Dev server       | Vite 8                             | n/a                                |
| Production build | Vite 8 (Rolldown engine)           | ✅ dropped                         |
| Testing          | Jest 30 + `babel-jest`             | ✅ Vitest 4                        |
| TypeScript       | `tsc` (type-check only, 1 config)  | `tsc` (noEmit, source only)        |
| Linting          | ✅ Oxlint (via `vp lint`)          | ✅ Oxlint (via `vp lint`)          |
| Formatting       | ✅ Oxfmt (via `vp fmt`)            | ✅ Oxfmt (via `vp fmt`)            |

### Pain Points

1. **Node-based linting/formatting is slow**: ESLint + Prettier on a codebase this size takes tens of
   seconds in CI. Oxlint (Rust-based, part of Vite+) is 50–100× faster, reducing lint time to under
   a second.

2. **TypeScript upgrade blocked by `@typescript-eslint`**: `@typescript-eslint/parser` must be updated
   to support each new TypeScript release and typically lags by weeks to months. Oxlint has built-in
   TypeScript support via oxc — no separate parser, no peer-dependency lag. This directly unblocks
   upgrading to TypeScript 6 / TypeScript 7 (Project Corsa).

3. ✅ **Two tsconfig files for jaeger-ui** (resolved in PR E): `tsconfig.json` was used by Vite
   (required `isolatedModules: true`) and a separate `tsconfig.lint.json` was used by `tsc -p` for
   type-checking (`isolatedModules: false`, `noEmit: true`). The split turned out to be unnecessary —
   Vite uses esbuild for transpilation and ignores `isolatedModules` in tsconfig entirely. The files
   have been merged into a single `tsconfig.json`.

4. **Jest + Babel test runner diverges from the build pipeline**: Jest uses `babel-jest` + a custom Babel
   plugin to work around `import.meta.NODE_ENV` in ESM-only packages (see
   `packages/jaeger-ui/test/babel-transform.js`). Vitest runs through the same Vite transform pipeline
   as the production build, eliminating this class of workaround.

### Why "Vite+"?

"Vite+" refers specifically to the `vp` CLI from [viteplus.dev](https://viteplus.dev) — a batteries-included
toolchain that wraps:

- **Vite / Rolldown** — dev server and production builds (already in use)
- **Oxlint** — replaces ESLint; native TypeScript rules, plus React hooks via `eslint-plugin-react-x` (jsPlugin)
- **Oxfmt** — replaces Prettier; native formatting
- **Vitest** — replaces Jest; shares the Vite transform pipeline

The key advantage over assembling these tools individually is that Vite+ internalises plugin compatibility,
so TypeScript upgrades do not require waiting for `@typescript-eslint` to catch up.

---

## Decision

Migrate the monorepo to Vite+ in phases:

1. ✅ **Drop the `packages/plexus` library build** — Webpack, Babel CLI, and all associated config removed.
2. ✅ **Consolidate legacy ESLint configs** — delete per-package `.eslintrc.*` files; root `eslint.config.js`
   now covers both packages. This is preparatory cleanup before replacing ESLint with Oxlint.
3. ✅ **Replace ESLint with Oxlint** — `@typescript-eslint` removed; TypeScript 6/7 upgrade now unblocked.
4. ✅ **Replace Prettier with Oxfmt** — `prettier` removed; `oxfmt --migrate=prettier` migrated the config.
5. ✅ **Upgrade TypeScript** — upgraded to 6.0.2; `moduleResolution` switched to `"bundler"`.
6. ✅ **Consolidate jaeger-ui tsconfigs** — `tsconfig.lint.json` deleted; `tsconfig.json` is the single config.
7. 🔶 **Replace Jest + Babel with Vitest** — plexus done ([#3690](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3690)); jaeger-ui pending.

---

## Detailed Change Plan

### ✅ 1. `packages/plexus` — Drop the Library Build ([#3677](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3677), [#3680](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3680))

`@jaegertracing/plexus` is no longer published to npm. The only consumer is `jaeger-ui`, which resolves
the package via a workspace source alias (`@jaegertracing/plexus` → `../plexus/src`) and never touches
the built `lib/` or `dist/` artifacts. The entire build pipeline — Babel CLI, Webpack, rimraf — existed
solely to produce output that no one uses.

**Implemented in full.** Webpack and Babel CLI are deleted; the `plexus` tsconfig is a pure type-check
config; `tsc-lint` resolves plexus types directly from source via `paths`.

#### ✅ 1a. Update `packages/plexus/package.json`

- ✅ **Removed** from `devDependencies` (build-only packages):
  - `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `webpack-node-externals`, `clean-webpack-plugin`, `babel-loader`
  - `babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types`
  - `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import`, `@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties`
  - `rimraf`, `npm-run-all2`

- **Remaining Babel deps** (`@babel/preset-env`, `@babel/preset-react`, `@babel/preset-typescript`,
  `@babel/plugin-transform-private-methods`, `babel-jest`) are used solely by the Jest test runner
  via `packages/plexus/test/babel-transform.js`. They will be removed in PR F when the plexus test
  runner is migrated to Vitest.

- ✅ **Replaced `build` script** (5-step Babel+Webpack pipeline) with `tsc --noEmit`. Removed
  `prepublishOnly` and all `_tasks/*` scripts.

- ✅ **Removed `files`** array — dead weight for an unpublished package.

- ✅ **Added `private: true`** — prevents accidental publish to npm.

- ✅ **Deleted files**:
  - `packages/plexus/babel.config.js`
  - `packages/plexus/webpack.umd.config.js`
  - `packages/plexus/webpack-factory.js`

- ✅ **Updated `scripts/generateDepcheckrcPlexus.js`**: removed the `babel.config.js` import and
  the code that processed it.

- ✅ **Updated root `package.json` `prepare` script**: removed the `prepublishOnly` invocation.

#### ✅ Prop-types removal (non-issue)

`packages/plexus/babel.config.js` applied `babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types`. Audit
found **no `propTypes` declarations** anywhere in `packages/plexus/src/`. The plugin was a no-op.
No action needed.

#### ✅ 1b. Update `packages/plexus/tsconfig.json`

The tsconfig is now a pure type-check config — `emitDeclarationOnly`, `outDir`, `rootDir`, `composite`,
and `declaration` are all removed. `noEmit: true` replaces them.

The prerequisite for this change was eliminating jaeger-ui's dependency on `lib/*.d.ts` for module
resolution. This is done via `paths` in `packages/jaeger-ui/tsconfig.json`:

```json
"paths": {
  "@jaegertracing/plexus": ["../plexus/src/index.ts"],
  "@jaegertracing/plexus/lib/*": ["../plexus/src/*"]
}
```

With this mapping, `@jaegertracing/plexus/lib/types` → `packages/plexus/src/types/index.ts` at
type-check time, and `lib/` never needs to exist. The Jest `moduleNameMapper` in
`packages/jaeger-ui/package.json` applies the equivalent mapping at test time.

`tsc-lint` is updated to run `tsc -p` for each package directly instead of `tsc --build` (project
references required `composite: true` which conflicts with `noEmit: true` and cross-package `paths`):

```json
"tsc-lint": "tsc -p packages/jaeger-ui/tsconfig.json && tsc -p packages/plexus/tsconfig.json"
```

`packages/jaeger-ui/tsconfig.json` is also simplified — `composite`, `outFile`, and the plexus
`references` entry are all removed. `noEmit: true` and `isolatedModules: false` are set directly
(see PR E — Vite ignores these options; it uses esbuild for transpilation).

`"main": "lib/index.js"` in `packages/plexus/package.json` was dead weight and was removed in PR E.

---

### ✅ 2. ESLint Config Consolidation — preparatory cleanup ([#3681](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3681))

**Implemented in full.** All three legacy ESLint config files are deleted; the root `eslint.config.js`
now covers both packages. This is a preparatory step — the consolidated flat config will be the thing
replaced by Oxlint in PR C.

#### Changes made

- Deleted `packages/plexus/.eslintrc.js` — it only set `@typescript-eslint/recommended` and `prettier`
  for TS files, both already provided by the root flat config via the `'./packages/*/tsconfig.json'` glob.
- Deleted `packages/jaeger-ui/.eslintrc.js` — it declared globals for Vite `define` constants already
  present in `commonGlobals` in the root flat config.
- Deleted `packages/jaeger-ui/src/demo/.eslintrc` — obsolete demo override with no active effect.
- Extended the root `eslint.config.js` TypeScript pattern from `**/*.{ts,tsx}` to `**/*.{ts,tsx,mts}` so
  `vite.config.mts` is linted under the same TypeScript rules.
- Added a `project: false` override for `packages/*/vite.config.mts` (not included in any tsconfig project).
- Removed stale `/* eslint-disable import/no-extraneous-dependencies */` from `vite.config.mts` (plugin is
  now named `import-x/`, and the rule is already `'off'` globally).
- Removed `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `eslint-config-prettier` from
  `packages/plexus/package.json` — these were only referenced by the deleted `.eslintrc.js`.

Result: 0 ESLint errors (250 pre-existing warnings, all `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` or similar).

---

### ✅ 3. Replace ESLint with Oxlint (PRs C1)

Oxlint is the linting component of the Vite+ toolchain. It is Rust-based and has no dependency on
`@typescript-eslint`, directly unblocking TypeScript 6/7 upgrades.

#### Approach: run Oxlint in parallel before replacing ESLint

Rather than replacing ESLint in a single step, PR C1 is split into two phases:

**✅ Phase 1 — parallel run ([#3682](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3682)):**
- Add `vite-plus` to root devDependencies (which brings Oxlint transitively).
- Add an `oxlint` config (`.oxlintrc.json`) that mirrors the currently active ESLint rules.
- Add an `npm run oxlint` script that runs non-blocking alongside `npm run eslint` in CI.
- Compare Oxlint and ESLint output side by side.

**✅ Phase 2 — cutover ([#3684](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3684), once Phase 1 validates parity):**
- Remove `eslint`, `eslint-plugin-*`, `@typescript-eslint/*` from devDependencies.
- Remove `eslint.config.js`.
- Update CI `lint` script, `lint-staged`, and `husky` hooks to use Oxlint only.
- Update TypeScript to 6.x (PR D).

#### Success criteria for Phase 1

1. **Rule coverage**: every rule currently set to `error` or `warn` in `eslint.config.js` has a
   documented Oxlint equivalent — or a deliberate decision to drop it with written justification.
2. **Warning count parity**: Oxlint warning count is within the same order of magnitude as ESLint's
   current ~250 warnings. A significantly lower count is a signal that rules are missing, not that
   the code improved. The bulk of current warnings are `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`;
   the Oxlint equivalent `typescript/no-explicit-any` must fire on the same sites.
3. **Error parity**: the rules currently set to `error` — `react-x/rules-of-hooks`,
   `react-x/exhaustive-deps`, `jest/no-focused-tests`, `jest/no-identical-title`,
   `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type` — must all be caught by Oxlint equivalents.
4. **No significant false positives**: Oxlint should not flag substantially more than ESLint;
   a much higher count signals the config needs tuning before cutover.
5. **Performance**: Oxlint completes in under 1 second (verify the claimed 50–100× speedup).

See [Unknown 2](#unknown-2-oxlint-rule-coverage) for the rule mapping table.

---

### ✅ 4. Replace Prettier with Oxfmt (PR C2 — [#3686](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3686))

**Implemented in full.**

- Ran `oxfmt --migrate=prettier` to generate `.oxfmtrc.json` from the existing `prettier` config in `package.json`. All options mapped 1:1 (`arrowParens`, `printWidth`, `proseWrap`, `singleQuote`, `trailingComma`). Ignore patterns migrated from `.prettierignore` → `ignorePatterns` in `.oxfmtrc.json`.
- Removed `prettier` from `devDependencies`.
- Removed `prettier` config block from `package.json`.
- Deleted `.prettierignore` (replaced by `ignorePatterns` in `.oxfmtrc.json`).
- Updated scripts: `prettier` → `vp fmt`, `prettier-lint` → `fmt-lint` (using `vp fmt --check`).
- Updated `lint-staged` to use `vp fmt` instead of `prettier --write`.
- Output parity: only 1 file had a difference (trailing space in a comment line in `TraceDiff.test.js`) — fixed.

---

### ✅ 5. Upgrade TypeScript (PR D — [#3688](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3688))

Once `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` are removed from the dependency
tree (after PR C), TypeScript can be upgraded freely without waiting for plugin compatibility.

Upgraded TypeScript from 5.9.3 to 6.0.2. Two fixes required:

- Root `tsconfig.json`: changed `"moduleResolution": "node"` → `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`.
  TypeScript 6.0 deprecates `"node"` (alias `"node10"`) as it does not support the modern
  `"exports"` field in `package.json`. `"bundler"` accurately reflects how Vite resolves modules.
- `packages/plexus/tsconfig.json`: added `"types": ["jest"]` because TypeScript 6.0 tightened
  `@types` auto-discovery under `moduleResolution: "bundler"` — Jest globals were no longer found
  automatically. (Later changed to `"types": ["vitest/globals"]` in PR F when plexus migrated to Vitest.)

---

### ✅ 6. TypeScript Config Simplification (PR E — [#3689](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3689))

**Implemented.** `packages/jaeger-ui/tsconfig.lint.json` is deleted. Its settings (`isolatedModules: false`,
`noEmit: true`, `files` list) are merged directly into `packages/jaeger-ui/tsconfig.json`. The `tsc-lint`
script now points at `tsconfig.json` for both packages.

Key finding: Vite does not enforce or care about `isolatedModules` in tsconfig at build time — it uses
esbuild for transpilation, not tsc. Setting `isolatedModules: false` in `tsconfig.json` has no effect on
the build or dev server. The concern in Unknown 1 was unfounded.

Also removed the stale `"main": "lib/index.js"` field from `packages/plexus/package.json` (dead weight
since the library build was dropped in PR A).

---

### 7. CI Workflow Changes

#### `.github/workflows/lint-build.yml`

The `lint` script will change from `eslint` + `prettier` to `vp check` (or separate `oxlint` + `oxfmt`
invocations). The `depcheck` step will need its configuration updated to remove references to ESLint/Prettier
packages being deleted.

#### `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml`

`npm run coverage` invokes the per-workspace `coverage` scripts. Under Vitest this becomes `vitest run
--coverage`. The coverage output format (Codecov lcov) is specified in the Vitest config:

```typescript
coverage: {
  reporter: ['text', 'lcov'],
}
```

No changes to the workflow YAML itself are expected; the Codecov upload step consumes
`coverage/lcov.info` which Vitest produces in the same location as Jest.

#### `.github/workflows/check_bundle.yml`

No changes needed — this workflow runs `npm run build` and measures `du -sb packages/jaeger-ui/build`,
both of which are unaffected by switching the lint/test tooling.

---

### 8. Both Packages — Replace Jest + Babel with Vitest (PR F)

**Partially done.** `packages/plexus` migrated to Vitest in [#3690](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3690).
`packages/jaeger-ui` remains on Jest + Babel and is the next step.

#### plexus migration (✅ complete in [#3690](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3690))

- Added `vitest`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `jsdom` to devDependencies; removed `jest`, `babel-jest`,
  `jest-environment-jsdom`, all `@babel/*` packages, `@types/jest`.
- Added `packages/plexus/vitest.config.ts` with `environment: 'jsdom'`, `globals: true`,
  `moduleNameMapper` for CSS, and coverage settings.
- Replaced `packages/plexus/test/jest-per-test-setup.js` with `test/vitest-setup.ts`:
  - Imports `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` for matcher compatibility.
  - Sets `(global as any).jest = vi` so existing `jest.fn()` / `jest.clearAllMocks()` calls in test
    files continue to work **without rewriting them**.
- `jest.mock(` calls (4 test files + demo) renamed to `vi.mock(` — the one API that cannot be aliased
  because Vitest's transform hoists `vi.mock(` patterns statically before imports, whereas `jest.mock(`
  is left in place and never hoisted.
- Six test files renamed `.test.js` → `.test.jsx` so Vite/esbuild parses their JSX syntax correctly.
- Mock factory functions updated for Vitest ESM:
  - All default-exported modules must be returned as `{ default: MockComponent }` inside factory bodies.
  - `jest.requireActual()` replaced with `async vi.importActual()` (async in Vitest).
  - Constructor mocks passed to `vi.fn()` must use regular `function` expressions, not arrow functions
    (Vitest 4.x rejects arrow functions called with `new`).
  - `vi.fn()` (not the `jest` alias) must be used inside `vi.mock()` factory bodies — the alias is not
    available in hoisted factory scope.
- Deleted `test/babel-transform.js` and `test/generic-file-transform.js` (no longer needed).

#### Lessons learned (applicable to jaeger-ui migration)

| Situation | Vitest behaviour | Action required |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `jest.fn()`, `jest.clearAllMocks()`, etc. | Not available by default | Alias: `global.jest = vi` in setup file |
| `jest.mock()` / `jest.unmock()` | Not hoisted by transform | Rename to `vi.mock()` / `vi.unmock()` |
| `jest.requireActual(mod)` | Synchronous, CommonJS | Replace with `await vi.importActual(mod)` (async factory) |
| Default-export mocks | Factory can return component directly | Must return `{ default: MockComponent }` |
| Constructor mocks via `mockImplementation` | Arrow functions fail with `new` | Use regular `function() { return {...}; }` |
| `vi.fn()` inside `vi.mock()` factory | `jest` alias not in scope | Use `vi.fn()` explicitly |
| JSX in `.js` test files | Vite/esbuild skips JSX transform for `.js` | Rename to `.jsx` |
| `require()` inside test scope | Unavailable in ESM | Use top-level ES `import` |

#### jaeger-ui migration (pending)

The same strategy applies but at much larger scale (226 test files, ~2600 tests). Additional concerns:

- `packages/jaeger-ui/test/jest-per-test-setup.js` mocks browser APIs (`ResizeObserver`, `matchMedia`,
  `requestAnimationFrame`) with `jest.fn()` — covered by the `global.jest = vi` alias.
- `importMetaTransform` Babel plugin in `test/babel-transform.js` is eliminated (Vitest runs native ESM).
- Snapshot files may need regeneration — see Unknown 3.
- `transformIgnorePatterns` for ESM packages (`redux-actions`, `d3-*`) become unnecessary — see Unknown 5.

---

### 9. Documentation Changes (PR G)

- Update `CLAUDE.md`:
  - Replace ESLint/Prettier commands with `vp check` equivalents.
  - Replace Jest/`npm test` references with Vitest commands.
  - Replace `npm test -- --testPathPattern=<pattern>` with `npx vitest run <pattern>`.
  - Replace `npm run update-snapshots` guidance.

- Update `README.md` (if it mentions Jest or Babel in the dev setup section).

- Delete or archive `packages/jaeger-ui/test/babel-transform.js` (it has a detailed comment explaining the
  `import.meta` workaround — preserve context in the ADR or a commit message).

---

## Unknowns and Experiments

### ✅ Unknown 1: tsconfig consolidation — removing `tsconfig.lint.json`

**Resolved.** `isolatedModules: false` and `noEmit: true` merged into `tsconfig.json`. Vite build and
`tsc-lint` both pass. Vite does not enforce or interpret `isolatedModules` — it uses esbuild for
transpilation, so the tsconfig value has no effect on builds or the dev server.

---

### ✅ Unknown 2: Oxlint rule coverage

**Risk**: Oxlint may not have direct equivalents for all currently active ESLint rules.

**Active ESLint rules to map** (from `eslint.config.js`, excluding `'off'` entries):

| ESLint rule | Severity | Oxlint equivalent | Status |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| `react-x/rules-of-hooks` | error | `react-x/rules-of-hooks` (via jsPlugin) | ✅ |
| `react-x/exhaustive-deps` | error | `react-x/exhaustive-deps` (via jsPlugin) | ✅ |
| `jest/no-focused-tests` | error | `jest/no-focused-tests` | ✅ |
| `jest/no-identical-title` | error | `jest/no-identical-title` | ✅ |
| `jest/no-disabled-tests` | warn | `jest/no-disabled-tests` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` | warn | `typescript/no-explicit-any` | ✅ ~211 hits (vs ~250 in ESLint) |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` | warn | `no-unused-vars` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-use-before-define` | warn | `no-use-before-define` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare` | warn | `no-redeclare` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-shadow` | warn | `no-shadow` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` | warn | `typescript/no-require-imports` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-restricted-types` | warn | `typescript/no-restricted-types` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-function-type` | warn | `typescript/no-unsafe-function-type` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-wrapper-object-types` | warn | `typescript/no-wrapper-object-types` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` | warn | `typescript/ban-ts-comment` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-useless-constructor` | warn | `no-useless-constructor` | ✅ |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type` | error | `typescript/no-empty-object-type` | ✅ |
| `prettier/prettier` | error | dropped — Oxfmt handles formatting (PR C2) | — |

**Parallel run results** (Phase 1 complete):
- ESLint: 0 errors, 250 warnings
- Oxlint: 0 errors, 394 warnings (144 extra from `correctness: warn` — mostly jest correctness
  rules like `no-conditional-expect`, `expect-expect`, `valid-title` that ESLint wasn't checking)
- One `no-control-regex` false positive in `vite.config.mts` suppressed with an inline disable comment
  (`\0` is intentional — strips Rolldown's null-byte module prefix)
- `.cjs` files added to ignore patterns (were never linted by ESLint either)

**Success criteria**: All met. Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (cutover) in a follow-up PR.

---

### Unknown 3: Vitest snapshot compatibility

**Status**: Not yet validated for `jaeger-ui`. Plexus has no snapshot tests, so this unknown remains
open for the `jaeger-ui` migration.

**Risk**: Vitest's snapshot serializer may produce subtly different output for component snapshots compared
to Jest's `jest-snapshot`. Existing `.snap` files may need to be regenerated even if functionally equivalent.

**Experiment**:
1. Run `vitest run` and observe which snapshot tests fail with "1 snapshot obsolete" vs actual content
   mismatches.
2. Run `vitest run --update` to regenerate snapshots and diff against the originals.

**Success criteria**: Snapshot diffs are limited to whitespace or serializer formatting differences, not
semantic regressions. After update, all snapshot tests pass.

---

### Unknown 4: Vitest jsdom API coverage for existing test setup

**Status**: Partially resolved via plexus migration. The `global.jest = vi` alias strategy works —
confirmed in plexus where `jest.fn()` / `jest.clearAllMocks()` calls continue to work without renaming.
`@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` import path is confirmed correct. Remaining jaeger-ui-specific
concerns (browser API mocks, `process.env.TZ`, globalSetup isolation) still need validation.

**Risk**: The `packages/jaeger-ui/test/jest-per-test-setup.js` mocks several browser APIs (`ResizeObserver`,
`MessageChannel`, `matchMedia`, `requestAnimationFrame`) using `jest.fn()`. Under Vitest these will be
covered by the `global.jest = vi` alias. The `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers need the
Vitest-compatible import path (`@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest`).

Additionally, the `globalSetup` mechanism differs: Jest's `globalSetup` runs in the Node context before
workers; Vitest's `globalSetup` does the same but the process isolation model differs.

**Experiment**:
1. Port the setup file to use `global.jest = vi` alias (not a full `vi.*` rewrite) and run a representative
   subset of tests (e.g., Ant Design component tests, Redux-connected components) to confirm that mocks
   behave identically.
2. Verify `process.env.TZ = 'UTC'` propagates correctly under Vitest's globalSetup.

**Success criteria**: All previously-passing tests pass under Vitest without mock-related failures.

---

### Unknown 5: `transformIgnorePatterns` equivalents in Vitest

**Status**: Confirmed non-issue for plexus (no ESM-only `node_modules` deps). Jaeger-ui still needs
validation for `redux-actions`, `d3-zoom`, `d3-selection`, but the expectation remains that Vitest's
native ESM pipeline makes `transformIgnorePatterns` unnecessary.

**Risk**: Jest required explicit `transformIgnorePatterns` to process ESM-only packages in `node_modules`
(`redux-actions`, `d3-zoom`, `d3-selection`, `@jaegertracing/plexus`). Vitest's Vite transform pipeline
handles ESM natively, so these patterns should be unnecessary. However, some packages may have non-standard
package exports or dual-mode CJS/ESM issues that surface differently under Vitest.

**Experiment**:
1. Run the full test suite without any `server.deps.inline` configuration in Vitest.
2. For any package that causes `SyntaxError` or import failures, add it to `server.deps.inline` in the Vitest
   config (this is the Vitest equivalent of `transformIgnorePatterns`).

**Success criteria**: No `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement in a module` errors. The `import.meta`
Babel workaround for `redux-actions` is confirmed unnecessary.

---

### Unknown 6: `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` interaction with Vitest

**Status**: Not yet validated. Applies only to `jaeger-ui`.

**Risk**: `packages/jaeger-ui/vite.config.mts` currently uses `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` to emit a legacy
browser bundle. Vitest ignores `transformIndexHtml` hooks so the plugin should be harmless, but this needs
confirming.

**Experiment**: Run `vitest run` with the existing `vite.config.mts` (which includes `plugin-legacy`) and

## Consequences

### Positive (full migration)

- **Single dependency**: Replace `eslint`, `prettier`, `typescript-eslint`, `babel`, `jest` and ~25 related
  packages with `vite-plus`.
- **Native performance**: Oxlint reduces lint time from ~30–60 s to under 1 s. Rolldown build times drop
  significantly vs Webpack.
- **No TypeScript upgrade lag**: Oxlint has built-in TypeScript support via oxc; TypeScript 6/7 upgrades
  are no longer blocked by `@typescript-eslint` release schedule.
- **Unified transform pipeline**: Vitest runs tests through the same Vite/Rolldown pipeline as the
  production build, eliminating the `importMetaTransform` Babel hack.
- **Already mostly done**: The plexus build pipeline is gone (PR A), legacy ESLint configs are gone (PR B).

### Negative / Risks

- **Migration effort**: Vitest migration requires updating the test suite API, potentially regenerating
  snapshots, and validating Unknowns 3–6.
- **Oxlint rule parity**: Some ESLint rules may not have direct Oxlint equivalents — needs investigation
  (Unknown 2).

## Migration Order

### PR → Unknown dependency table

| PR | Description | Blocking unknowns | Can ship |
|----|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| ✅ A | Drop plexus library build; simplify plexus tsconfig; paths-based type resolution ([#3677](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3677), [#3680](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3680)) | None | Done |
| ✅ B | Delete legacy ESLint configs from both packages — prep for Oxlint ([#3681](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3681)) | None | Done |
| ✅ C1 | Replace ESLint with Oxlint ([#3682](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3682), [#3684](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3684)) | Unknown 2 | Done |
| ✅ C2 | Replace Prettier with Oxfmt ([#3686](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3686)) | None | Done |
| ✅ D  | Upgrade TypeScript to 6.0.2 ([#3688](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3688)) | None | Done |
| ✅ E  | Consolidate `jaeger-ui` tsconfigs; remove `main` from plexus package.json ([#3689](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3689)) | Unknown 1 | Done |
| 🔶 F | Migrate Jest → Vitest in both packages; remove Babel test deps ([#3690](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/3690) plexus ✅, jaeger-ui pending) | Unknowns 3, 4, 5, 6 | Partial |
| G  | Update CLAUDE.md, README, CI workflows | None | After F |

### Investigation strategy

- **Unknown 2** (Oxlint rules): ✅ Resolved — parallel run completed; rule coverage confirmed; ESLint removed.
- **Unknown 1** (tsconfig): ✅ Resolved — tsconfig files merged; `tsc-lint` and Vite build both pass.
- **Unknowns 3–6** (Vitest): Partially validated via plexus migration (PR F / #3690). Unknowns 4 and 5
  confirmed non-issues for plexus. Unknowns 3 and 6 remain open for jaeger-ui (snapshots and plugin-legacy).

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep ESLint + Prettier permanently

Rejected. `@typescript-eslint` creates a recurring TypeScript upgrade blocker. Oxlint removes this
entirely while providing faster feedback.

### Use `@swc/jest` instead of Vitest

SWC-based Jest transformers are faster than Babel-based ones and would eliminate the separate Babel
test config. However, they still run in Jest's CommonJS-by-default environment, keeping the `import.meta`
problem. Not pursued as a stepping stone — Vitest is the right destination.

### Use Vite library mode for plexus instead of dropping the build

Plexus is consumed only within this monorepo via a workspace source alias. There is no external consumer
of the built artifacts, making any build pipeline purely overhead. Dropping the build entirely (PR A) is
simpler than replacing Webpack with Vite library mode.

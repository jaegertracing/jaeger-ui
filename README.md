# Jaeger UI

Visualize distributed tracing with Jaeger.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development

The app was built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Running the application

Fork, then clone the `jaeger-ui` repo and change directory into it.

```
git clone https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui.git
cd jaeger-ui
```

Use the recommended npm and Node versions: (defined in [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc) file):

```
nvm use
```

Install dependencies via `npm` or `yarn`:

```
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Make sure you have the Jaeger Query service running on http://localhost:16686.
For example, you can run Jaeger all-in-one Docker image as descibed in the [documentation][aio-docs].

If you don't have it running locally, then tunnel to the correct host and port.

```
ssh -fN -L 16686:$BACKEND_HOST:$BACKEND_PORT $BACKEND_PORT
```

Start the development server with hot loading:

```
npm start
```

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm start` | Starts development server with hot reloading and api proxy. |
| `npm test` | Runs all the tests |
| `npm run lint` | Lint the project (eslint, prettier, flow) |
| `npm run build` | Runs production build. Outputs files to `/dist`. |


## Build

Running build will output all the static files to the `./dist` folder:

```
npm install
npm run build
```
